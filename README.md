# Wallet

## Introduction

The wallet provider is a plug-in that integrates various blockchain wallet APIs to connect to Dapp (send transactions, personal signatures, deploy contracts).

Now integrated Metamask, Walletconnect, Walletlink, Portis.

Other wallets are being supported one after another (Walletconnect protocol has been adopted by dozens of popular wallets).

The src directory is the source code implementation of the plug-in, and the lib directory is the compiled file (ES5 is compiled by default because some advanced features of ES6 are not yet supported by the browser).

The UI self-service interface has not been provided, and it needs to be implemented by itself (because it is only built with JS, I want to apply it in any JS environment, not in the specified framework).

Support TS, comes with type declaration file.âœ…

If you feel unsatisfied with the writing, you can modify and build it yourself.ðŸ˜Š
